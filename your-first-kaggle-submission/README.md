# Make your first Kaggle submission!

The Jupyter notebook goes through the Kaggle Titanic dataset via an exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Python and finishes with making a submission.

You can download the data from this repo or [directly from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

A full blog post to go along with the video and code is available [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-exploratory-data-analysis-f11d843b8184).
